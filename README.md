# VIEWS Outreach

Welcome to the VIEWS Outreach repository! Here we collect instructions for data access and documentation of known issues with implications for use of our data, as well as a series of notebooks, scripts, and other helpful tools addressing common requests and/or output for specific projects.  

**Key resources for end users:**

- *data-access* contains instructions on how to access VIEWS data.
- *data-exploration* contains a set of sample scripts and Jupyter notebooks to fetch, explore, visualize, and download subsets of data; helper tools for the most common requests we receive. 
- *known-issues* documents past (now fixed) issues with the VIEWS model and/or data with implications for users thereof. This includes, e.g., bugs in the model code and issues related to the processing or quality of input data informing the VIEWS model. For open (noted but yet unresolved) issues, please see the Issues tab.
  
For questions about the VIEWS model and/or data, please contact us at views@pcr.uu.se.
