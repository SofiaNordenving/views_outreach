# VIEWS Outreach

Welcome to the VIEWS Outreach repository!

Here we collect instructions for data access and documentation of known issues with implications for use of our data, as well as a series of notebooks, scripts, and other helpful tools addressing common requests and/or output for specific projects.  

**Key resources for users of VIEWS data:**

- *data-access* contains instructions on how to access VIEWS data.
- *data-exploration* contains a set of sample scripts and Jupyter notebooks to fetch, explore, and download subsets of VIEWS data from the VIEWS API; helper tools for the most common requests we receive.
- *data-visualization* contains batch scripts and sample notebooks to visualize VIEWS data using our standard settings and visual profile. 
- *known-issues* describes how and where we document known issues related to the VIEWS model and/or data with implications for our users. Issues include, e.g., bugs in the model code and issues related to the processing or quality of input data informing the VIEWS model. Links to related repositories are also provided.

**Resources for the VIEWS team:**
- *codebooks* contains the master codebooks for input data and predictions, and scripts to produce codebooks for different use cases.
